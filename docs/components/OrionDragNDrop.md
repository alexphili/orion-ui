# Orion Drag'n Drop

The drag'n drop feature is a combination of two components.

`<o-droppable>` is used to create the drop zone.

It must be combined with the `<o-draggable>` component, which will be an item of this component and can be dropped in different `<o-droppable>` areas.

Take a look at the example's source code below to get a better idea of the mecanism.
