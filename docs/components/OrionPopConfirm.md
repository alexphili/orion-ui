# OrionPopConfirm

`<o-pop-confirm>` shows a confirmation popup over the element in the `default` slot.

It takes place when `useConfirm()` is too heavy and breaks the UX.

It's a more convenient way to implement this mecanism for actions with a smaller impact.

Like with `useConfirm()`, you can press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to **confirm** and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to **cancel**.
