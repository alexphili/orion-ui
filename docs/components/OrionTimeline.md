# OrionTimeline

`<o-timeline>` displays a timeline and must be used with the `<o-timeline-pane>` component ([more infos below](#orion-timeline-pane)).

Its mecanism is very similar with the `<o-tabs>` component ([more infos here](../components/OrionTabs.md)). 

It can be useful if you want to diplay elements in a chronological order.
